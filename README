QIPS-NODE README
================
Part of the QIPS, the node is responsible for polling a queue for messages.
Once it finds a message it'll do a unit of work, replace the message back on 
the finished queue, and then delete the message.

This was built with the default daemon kit:

DaemonKit README

Logging
=======

One of the biggest issues with writing daemons are gettign insight into what your
daemons are doing. Logging with DaemonKit is simplified as DaemonKit creates log
files per environment in log.

On all environments except production the log level is set to DEBUG, but you can
toggle the log level by sending the running daemon SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals.
SIGUSR1 will toggle between DEBUG and INFO levels, SIGUSR2 will blatantly set the
level to DEBUG.
